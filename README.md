# Python-Zoom-LogBot
There you have it, an auto-logger for your Zoom meetings.

### YOU MUST HAVE THE PYTHON LANGUAGE INSTALLED ON YOUR DEVICE FOR THIS TO WORK ALONG WITH ALL THE LIBRARIES.
### INSTALL PYTHON FROM https://python.org or https://www.anaconda.com/
### INSTALL LIBRARIES BY TYPING 'pip install module' where module is the name of the library in the command prompt.

Now, for you to use it, follow these steps for setting up your bot successfully.

From the 'Zoom' folder from this repository, you will find files like 'Mon.csv', 'Tue.csv'.etc.


Inside these, you have to fill the timings and code and passwords, in the form 
  'TIME, CODE, PASSWORD'
  '12:30, 12345678, 'ABCDEFGH'
  '09:40, 98765432, None 
  

### NOTE: If you do not have any password for your meeting, you can simply leave it blank


### FOR TIMINGS BEFORE 10 AM, Please add a '0' before the hour value, like '9:30' as '09:30' or it won't work

Then, your bot is almost just done.

You just need to start the bot by giving the path in the command prompt or terminal and type
#python Logger.py

And there you go, your bot has started!
