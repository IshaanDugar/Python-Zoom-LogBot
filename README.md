# Python-Zoom-LogBot
There you have it, an auto-logger for your Zoom meetings.

Now, for you to use it, follow these steps for setting up your bot successfully.

STEP 1
From the 'Zoom' folder from this repositery, you will find files like 'Mon.csv', 'Tue.csv'.etc.
Inside these, you have to fill the timings and code and passwords, in the form 
  'TIME, CODE, PASSWORD'
  '12:30, 12345678, 'ABCDEFGH'
  '09:40, 98765432, None 

#NOTE: If you do not have any password for your meeting, you can simply leave it blank
#FOR TIMINGS BEFORE 10 AM, Please add a '0' before the time, like '9:30' as '09:30'

Then, your bot is almost just done.

You just need to start the bot by giving the path in the command prompt or terminal and type
#python Logger.py

And there you go, your bot has started!
